# CMPE 321 Projects

Welcome to my **CMPE 321** (Introduction to Database Systems) projects repository!  
Here, Iâ€™ll share the programming assignments I work on during the semester.

## Course Focus
- **Database schema design** (ER and Relational Models)
- **SQL** for data manipulation and retrieval
- **Normalization** for refined database structures
- **Indexing** strategies and **query optimization**
- **Transactions** and **basic crash recovery**

## Projects Overview
1. **Database Design & ER Modeling**  
   - Analyze a scenario, create ER diagrams, and build relational schemas.

2. **SQL & Simple App Development**  
   - Implement SQL queries with joins, subqueries, and aggregates.
   - Integrate these queries into a basic application.

3. **Indexing & Query Optimization**  
   - Create and test different indexing techniques.
   - Compare query execution plans for performance insights.

4. **Transactions & Recovery**  
   - Practice transaction operations (commit, rollback).
   - Implement simple recovery mechanisms.

*Note:* Project details and instructions will be added to individual folders in this repo. Stay tuned for updates!
